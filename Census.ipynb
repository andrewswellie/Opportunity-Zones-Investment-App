The City of Columbus is spending $30 million to impove the Hgih Street streetscape which is the backbone corridor in the area. These major projects will prime the area for revitilization and development. One of the most significant projects currently underway is the continuing development of bus rapid transit in partnership with the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA). This project includes $48 million to complete construction and installation of CMAX routes through the area. This project was undertaken to prepare for significant future development and encourage use of mass transit.</th>\n",

Nearly $100 million has been invested in the State Route 32 corridor which is part of the Appalachian Highway System. Clermont County has invested nearly $10 million in South Afton Industrial Park and expect it to be the first site in southwest Ohio to be certified by JobsOhio. ? Clermont county spent $4.9 million in 2016 to buy the 242 acre site at Half Acre Road ? Site is one of 5 Southwest Ohio sites being evaluated for SiteOhio Certification program ? Clermont County has invested in the site since 2016, including construction of an industrial road for half of the site. ? According to the University of Cincinnati Economic Center, the site could provide 1,855 permanent jobs and support an additional 1,675 jobs with a payroll impact of up to $186 million ? Clermont County Department of Economic Development invested significantly in a site-specific website as well as print and digital materials that led to a 25% increase in the number of active leads. ? The Clermont County Transportation Improvement District (TID) invested $82MM to improve the I-275/ SR 32 interchange, which is the main SR that leads to the site. These investments will improve access to South Afton Industrial Park. ? South Afton is partnering with Miller-Valentine Group for build-to-suit options. Through this partnership, companies considering the site will receive free construction options including construction costs estimates, preliminary site layout plans, financing assistance, and comparisons of ownership options including construction only, design-build or build-to-suit for lease.</th>\n",
