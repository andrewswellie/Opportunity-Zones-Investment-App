A major transportation corridor in Lima which provides access to I-75 is located in Census Tract 126 along with a major corporate partner and investor, Lima Memorial Hospital. Projects recently completed or underway: - Lima Memorial Hospital is current planning a significant expansion of approximately 54,000 square feet of professional office buildings. The additional facility will provide walk-in care services, a full-service outpatient pharmacy, and a chronic disease management center. Completion of this project is expected in 2018, and the project is privately funded. - The City of Lima recently completed a $1.713 million renovation of Lima Stadium Park. The project was funded by a $1.485 million ODNR Community Recreation Grant, and approximately $228,000 in City of Lima utility and capital funds. Acquisition of land needed for the project was funded by private donors in the amount of $1.2 million, for a total project cost of $2.9 million.

Mercy Health has over 3,000 employees and volunteers in Lima on its approximately 40-acre campus. Future planned development: - Mercy Health is currently planning a $15 million residency education facility at Collett and Market Streets, across from the current hospital. The hospital will be bringing 80 new doctors to the area for its residency program, which will stimulate as much as $1 million in new housing development expected to occur largely in Census Tract 129 and/or in the adjacent Census Tract 141.

Significant investment has taken place in downtown Lima within the last two to five years. Projects that are recently completed or underway include: - 138 N Main St. is a historic building under renovation which includes the new Hollander restaurant, a private investment project, valued at $2 million. - The Met, a five-story mixed-use project at 306 N.

The project will be funded with an estimated $17 million in private dollars. The City of Lima contributed $56,000 toward the $356,000 roadway realignment and over $229,000 to the sewer relocation in order to support the project and ensure its success. - A local entrepreneur who has developed a regional chain of restaurants invested $4 million in private funds to renovate an existing downtown building into a successful upscale restaurant at 215 S. Main St. - The City of Lima created an Energy Special Improvement District for the entire City. Two projects, the Chamber of Commerce renovation and a retail/services building in downtown Lima, were the first projects utilizing PACE funding. - Union Square Apartments, a $5.1 million facility, opened in 2015. Funding for the project was provided through LIHTC, OCCH, the Ohio Housing Trust Fund, First Merit Bank and the City of Lima. Future planned development includes: - Rhodes State College is locating its Center for Health Science Education and Innovation on Town Square. The project will result in a $20 million publicly funded, newly constructed facility. - Additional renovation is planned at The Met for live/work suites on the upper floors, estimated to include $3.3 million in private investment and $1.4 million in state and federal historic tax credits. - The owner/developer of The Met has acquired a former 43,000± square foot industrial building and intends to use $4 million in private funds and $1.7 million in state and federal historic tax credits to renovate the four-story building for a female-owned brewery, a restaurant, entertainment venue, office and residential space. The proposed development will result in an estimated 55 new jobs. - A private developer is planning renovation of a long vacant 34,000± square foot building into market-rate residential rental units with associated retail/services. An estimated $5 million of private funding is expected to be invested in the endeavor. - Interest has been expressed by several private investors in a long vacant and deteriorating historic building at 122 N. Elizabeth St. Renovation of the structure is encouraged by the City of Lima and Allen County Land Reutilization Corporation. - The owner of a commercial building at 338 N Main St. has invested approximately $1 million in building renovation but is unable to complete the project. An opportunity exists for an investor to make final improvements and lease commercial retail/office space at this location which would continue downtown revitalization northward. While property owners and investors are taking advantage of programs such as PACE, historic tax credits, and CRA tax abatements to support development, Census Tract 141 is still distressed and blighted. Iconic buildings built in the 1800?s and 1900?s are vacant and/or deteriorating and would benefit from additional incentives to encourage private investment. Lima has proven that it possesses interested investors and developers, such as Met Place Properties Ltd and Walter Development Enterprises Co., who have already invested their own funds, raised capital, and made commitments to invest future dollars. Census Tract 141 is also ripe for some of the estimated $1 million in new residential development due to the planned $15 million medical residency education facility to be constructed by Mercy Health (St. Rita?s Medical Center) in the adjacent Census Tract 129.

As the factories shut down and jobs were lost, these communities have struggled with poverty, vacant buildings, aging transportation and water management infrastructure. Our vision is to rebuild the communities in the Lower Mill Creek Valley, returning the corridor to its role as one of the City?s most productive centers of economic activity.

WIN?s primary redevelopment target is tract 77, but it is our belief that the larger impact will come from making the entire Beekman Street Corridor an Opportunity Zone. The 3-mile Beekman Street Manufacturing Corridor is an historical epicenter of Cincinnati?s growth into an industrial powerhouse, with working class neighborhoods that sprang up within walking distance to the jobs at those factories. This area stretches from ODOT?s ongoing $200 million renovation of the I-75/74 Interchange, through tract 86 to tract 272, the location of the Metropolitan Sewer District?s $195 million green stormwater management project. The neighborhoods of South Cumminsville/Millvale (Tract 77), North Fairmount (Tract 86), and South Fairmount (Tract 272) are designated Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Areas (NRSAs) and part of a Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone. By combining these three contiguous census tracts into an Opportunity Zone, we can rebuild these communities, bring back the businesses and jobs that will live residents out of poverty and return the corridor to its historic role as a center for manufacturing and distribution. South Cumminsville/Millvale (Tract 77) has drawn $26.3 million of investment in current and planned projects, including: $5 million from the City ($4.5 million street/sidewalk rehab, $500k to parks), plus $550,000 from corporate funders (Cincinnati Reds, P&G) for major park and recreation center upgrades; Working In Neighborhoods? $6 million being raised to rehab and build 50 single-family owner-occupied ?Net Zero? homes; National Church Residences? $14 million multi-family project with 80 affordable rental units; and $1 million Cooper Electric expansion. Tract 77 is WIN?s highest priority Opportunity Zone tract for a number of reasons. First, South Cumminsville?s robust resident-led organizations have created strong partnerships with the City and local non-profit organizations. With WIN, the community?s ?South Cumminsville Out of Poverty? initiative has been developed to bring 40% of South Cumminsville residents out of poverty within a generation using a comprehensive, 6-prong strategy that incorporates housing, employment, education, health/fresh food access, transportation, and safety/beautification. Second, this working class African-American community has maintained a homeownership rate above 50 percent, and is home to a strong core of local businesses that include Truckway, one of Cincinnati?s largest trucking companies, as well as headquarters for F.D. Lawrence Electric Co., C.W. Wood Machinery, Inc., U.S. Industrial Lubricants, and Cooper Electric. South Cumminsville (Tract 77) is immediately adjacent to Cincinnati?s Northside neighborhood, which has undergone a remarkable transformation through public and private investments over the past 15 years. Increasing home values and a booming entertainment and retail district have made Northside one of the most popular neighborhoods in the city. New mixed-use development in Northside includes the $22 million renovation of the long-vacant American Can factory to create 110 market rate apartments, which leveraged $1.6 million of federal funds for an additional $20.4 in private investment, and the $15 million Gantry project, consisting of 131 market-rate apartments and 8,000 square feet of retail space. The City of Cincinnati has recently spent $3.2 million for street rehab and park upgrades. The Apple Street Market is breaking ground this year, leveraging $500k in city dollars to unlock $3.5 million in private investment to develop a full-service grocery store and provide new jobs. Finally, Cincinnati METRO is investing $320k in the Northside Transit Hub, the second busiest public transit center in Cincinnati, in order to better connect people with jobs. The $600 million ODOT Mill Creek Expressway project, including realignment of the I-75/74 interchange and the I-75 Hopple Street exit, is enhancing transportation access from north to south and east to west. The $5 million Mill Creek Greenway hike/bike trail is connecting neighborhoods along the Mill Creek and increasing opportunities for active transit.","South Cumminsville (Tract 77) is well-positioned to build on its existing strengths, particularly in light of the major investments in transit infrastructure and the booming commercial and residential redevelopment occurring next door in Northside.",12395,2854,1139,1139,819,320,694,-21.4013709063214,28.094820017559265

The site acquisition was intended to establish a much-needed development site within its urban core, while offering access to existing industrial infrastructure imperative to attracting new manufacturing operations; The site was renamed Metro West Commerce Park. Metro West required full-scale environmental assessment and complex soil and groundwater remediation, as the area?s +100-year heavy industrial history resulted in contamination and associated environmental liability the private market would not address. Acquisition, cleanup, demolition, and infrastructure improvement activities totaled $9.8 Million, which was funded through various local, State and Federal programs and competitive grants. The project was in-process for a decade, receiving environmental regulatory approvals in 2014 to accommodate development. The City also worked with Nehemiah Manufacturing Company, LLC (Nehemiah), a local consumer products manufacturer/re-packager, to realize its corporate mission to ?build brands, create jobs, and change lives?. Dan Meyer and Richard Palmer founded Nehemiah in 2009, leveraging their successful business experiences at companies including Procter & Gamble and other multi-million-dollar firms. Nehemiah creates job opportunities for the chronically unemployed in the inner city to achieve steady work and the hope of a better future. As Nehemiah?s space and production needs expanded, the City offered 7 of its newly-available acres to accommodate a new development and consolidation for Nehemiah, located in the heart of its target workforce population. The project includes construction of a new 180,000-sf, $12 Million office and warehouse facility. The building will house its corporate headquarters and all Nehemiah manufacturing/distribution functions, and uniquely offers social services in-house to holistically support its workforce beyond employment considerations.

Located immediately west of the City?s urban core, working class neighborhoods sprang up within walking distance to jobs at the breweries, pork processing plants, machine shops and soap factories that turned Cincinnati into an industrial powerhouse. As the factories shut down and jobs were lost, these communities have struggled with poverty, vacant buildings, aging transportation and water management infrastructure. Our vision is to rebuild the communities in the Lower Mill Creek Valley, returning the corridor to its role as one of the City?s most productive centers of economic activity. The neighborhoods of South Fairmount (Tract 272), South Cumminsville/Millvale (Tract 77), and North Fairmount (Tract 86), are designated as Neighborhood Revitalizations Strategy Areas (NRSA), and a Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Zone. A 2009 ?Growth and Opportunities (GO) Cincinnati? study recommended reindustrializing the corridor with advanced manufacturing. The City and County have focused on creating job-ready sites in key industrial locations along Beekman Street, identifying opportunity for development due to interstate highway access and proximity to local hospitals, educational institutions, and downtown. Precedent exists for the success of this plan in the neighborhood just north of these communities called Northside. Now a thriving center of activity and real estate, just 15 years ago, Northside was suffering from the same lack of investment. As a result of $44.5 million of investments into infrastructure, housing, transit and more the neighborhood has come back to life. We envision following the same model in the Lower Mill Creek Valley to renew the area. Already, government and private entities have noticed the opportunity: In North and South Fairmount: ? One of the most transformative projects is being led by Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) of Cincinnati. It is undertaking its largest project ever and one of the largest in the country. The heart of that project is in South Fairmount along its main road. MSD will spend $195 million on projects in South and North Fairmount, creating a public greenspace and green infrastructure to improve storm sewer run off. ? In addition, the city and county are replacing the nearby Western Hills Viaduct, a $400 million project that will improve transportation and access for all of the Mill Creek area. When these projects are finished, the now-blighted corridor will be ready for redevelopment with an influx of capital and people. ? Just last year, Cincinnati Public Schools used $1.3 million to renovate the old North Fairmount Elementary, turning it into a magnet school that attracts families from around the city. ? Nearby, in English Woods, (census tract 86), the Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing Authority is beginning redevelopment of 45 acres- the largest piece of vacant residential land in the city, with plans to create an urban village. This will mean an influx of homeowners and renters with demand for a renewed business district. In South Cumminsville: ? Planned $1 million from WIN for sustainable housing ? $4.5 million invested in improved roads and sidewalks ? Planned $14.5 million investment into housing by a nonprofit developer ? $1 million expansion by local industry ? $800,000 into parks and recreation from the city and Cincinnati businesses These neighborhoods are geographically and culturally connected. An investment in one will spur growth in the others. With a thriving community just north in Northside and a huge infrastructure project underway in the southern end, the Beekman Corridor or Lower Mill Creek Valley lacks only serious and sustained investment to jumpstart its renewal.","I live in this community and I believe that due to current conditions, this site would benefit most from the Opportunity Zone Program",19107,6218,833,833,609,224,898,-30.033608310418575,26.89075630252101

The Salem Avenue Corridor in Northwest Dayton has long been a vibrant commercial and residential sector of the city. Since being platted in the 1930s and 1940s, the area has played host to numerous small businesses, places of worship, and anchor institutions. Salem Avenue itself serves as a vital artery stretching from the Great Miami River North of Downtown, to the Northwest corner of the city and beyond. The significant thoroughfares in the geography (Salem Ave., Philadelphia Ave., Cornell Dr., Gettysburg Ave., and Hillcrest Dr.) transport hundreds of thousands of people each year from across the region. Major businesses and institutions in and near Northwest Dayton include Good Samaritan Hospital, the Miami Valley Country Club, Dayton Metro Library?s Northwest branch, Omega Baptist Church, and Kroger. Many gains have been made in the area through the work of the Phoenix Project in which Good Samaritan Hospital/ Premier Health has been a critical partner. The project has promoted the construction of the Fairview Elementary School and Fairview Commons, the construction of a new Northwest Branch of the Dayton Metro Library, the Phoenix Rising new housing development, the removal of numerous dilapidated structures, the opening of the Five Rivers Health Center, and the creation of the Salem/Catalpa intersection gateway. New programs to serve neighborhood youth and reduce crime through community policing have also been successful. Early this year, Premier Health announced that it will close Good Samaritan Hospital in 2018. Good Sam has been the major, sustaining anchor in Northwest Dayton for over 80 years. While its closure presents many challenges, through the Phoenix Next initiative, Premier has pledged to work with the city and neighborhoods toward redevelopment of the multi-acre hospital site. This site is the largest to open up in this area in years and presents an opportunity to build on the gains made in the area through the Phoenix Project and introduce new amenities, businesses, job opportunities and/or housing products. The significant recent investments in Northwest Dayton coupled with Premier?s pledge to support redevelopment efforts provide a unique opportunity to attract continued interest in the area. The intersection of Salem and Philadelphia at the heart of the geography is only minutes away from two interstate highways, and there is no shortage of developable land or buildings to facilitate new business creation and expansion. Salem Avenue is also scheduled for an $8 million rebuild beginning in 2021 that will enhance the area?s potential for further investment. Northwest Dayton is densely populated, geographically important, and extremely diverse. The Salem Avenue corridor/ Good Samaritan area has massive potential for anyone hoping to start or expand a business.

The 31,400-square foot facility will focus on addressing the three major factors in poverty reduction: workforce development, health and wellness improvement, and capacity building through education.

While its closure presents many challenges, through the Phoenix Next initiative, Premier has pledged to work with the city and neighborhoods toward redevelopment of the multi-acre hospital site. This site is the largest to open up in this area in years and presents an opportunity to build on the gains made in the area through the Phoenix Project and introduce new amenities, businesses, job opportunities and/or housing products. The significant recent investments in Northwest Dayton coupled with Premier?s pledge to support redevelopment efforts provide a unique opportunity to attract continued interest in the area. The intersection of Salem and Philadelphia at the heart of the geography is only minutes away from two interstate highways, and there is no shortage of developable land or buildings to facilitate new business creation and expansion. Salem Avenue is also scheduled for an $8 million rebuild beginning in 2021 that will enhance the area?s potential for further investment. Northwest Dayton is densely populated, geographically important, and extremely diverse. The Salem Avenue corridor/ Good Samaritan area has massive potential for anyone hoping to start or expand a business. Opportunity Zone designation will undoubtedly enhance the already promising potential of these important tracts.","Contains the investment opportunity at what will be the former Good Samaritan Hospital; ability to build on investments, such as those at the Dayton Metro Library, the Boys and Girls Club, and the Hope Center.",34439,7125,2079,2070,1807,263,1518,-17.533490937746258,12.705314009661835

This tract encompasses downtown Dayton and the Oregon Historic District. This tract represents both a tremendous amount of momentum as well as opportunity. The strategic blueprint for downtown development is the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan, which was adopted in 2010. Investment since the launch of the plan has topped $1 billion and there is another $422 million in the pipeline. Major anchors in the area include Sinclair Community College, CareSource, Premier Health Partners, and the Dayton Metro Library. It in an intermodal transportation hub for the regional, including access via Interstate 75 and U.S. 35. Major investment has come in the form of development in new facilities for the Dayton Metro Library ($65M), CareSource (new office tower), Sinclair ($32M), Interstate 75 rebuild, new bridges, and the upcoming rehabilitation of the Arcade. The Opportunity Zone designation would match well with a number of other financial tools that are utilized in downtown development, such as Historic Tax Credits, New Market Tax Credits, Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE), Tax Increment Financing, and mission based revolving loan funds. A downtown Opportunity Zone would complement these tools and help us leverage our public investments to bring more private sector investment to downtown. The downtown startup community is growing and Dayton is starting to unlock the commercialization potential of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. United behind this vision, an array of institutional partners have coalesced downtown, including the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the University of Dayton (UD), Wright State University (WSU), the Wright Brothers Institute (WBI), and more. The downtown Dayton census tract is a rapidly growing innovation district. Through projects like the Dayton Arcade, which will feature a 100,000 square-foot startup hub anchored by UD and The Entrepreneurs Center, the momentum around startups and commercialization will soon reach new heights. Despite this momentum, angel investment, venture funding, and other sources of critical early stage capital are still lacking. An Opportunity Zone designation for downtown would be catalytic for attracting additional investment to support this startup and commercialization vision. Interest in downtown Dayton continues to accelerate. Over 500 housing units have been constructed in this tract since 2014. Both commercial and office interest has increased in recent years. However, the major tasks still lie ahead, and the designation of an Opportunity Zone would be instrumental in filling the vacant and underutilized commercial buildings along Main Street. Our urban core still struggles with more than two million square feet of vacancy and is just now recovering from the Great Recession. While downtown Dayton is improving, its continued revitalization is not guaranteed. An Opportunity Zone designation would accelerate downtown?s resurgence, which is vital to regional efforts to attract and retain talent and our community?s future economic success.","Ability to build on downtown momentum and capitalize on emerging innovation culture; capitalize on major investments of CareSource, Sinclair, Water Street, Dayton Metro Library and many others.",22202,8929,1811,1790,1623,167,1915,17.858248220365212,9.329608938547485

It is now home to a number of successful advanced manufacturing businesses like GEM CITY Engineering, Noble Tool and Angstron Materials, to name a few. These companies provide a strong presence in this area and are primed for investment opportunities. In recent years, both GEM CITY and Angstron Materials have secured funding through Montgomery County?s ED/GE Program. Additionally, Angstron Materials grew enough to acquire and refurbish to a third building in this area in 2017. In the last few years the company also secured the first $10 million of an investment from Western & Southern Financial group, with expectations for a total $23 million investment. Many of these advanced manufacturing businesses receive support and resources from the Dayton Regional Manufacturing Association (DRMA), which only serves to strengthen their presences in the community and region through initiatives like Manufacturing Day. Another strong institution in this area is the Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center, which opened in May of 2010 and is one of only 26 Kroc centers built across the country. The original investment was $40 million and the Center hopes to expand across the street in the coming years, which would result in an estimated additional investment of $4.3 million. Application evaluation criteria included site selection, budget development, fund-raising potential and funding sustainability, and partnerships with other organizations to name a few. The successful award and subsequent opening of the center demonstrates similar criteria that would appeal to other investors and philanthropists.

This tract contains major pieces of the West Dayton redevelopment strategy?the Dayton Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Wright Brothers factory site. These two anchors will help lead this vicinity into a resurgence predicated on the unique attributes of West Dayton. Further strengthening the case is its location along two major transportation corridors: U.S. 35 and West Third Street. U.S. 35 is the major east-west corridor through the City of Dayton. It represents great potential for users that need quick access to a controlled-access highway. West Third Street is the most important east-west surface street in the City of Dayton. It connects the Dayton VA, the Wright Factory site, the National Historical Park, and downtown Dayton. The Wright Factory site is comprised of 33 acres?including the world?s first airplane factory. This facility has been added to the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park and is seen to hold tremendous potential as a tech incubator or co-share area. Just to the west of the factory is the area targeted for a new Dayton Metro Library branch. Outside of the factory facility and the library site is a development opportunity that?considering these unique amenities?will be attractive for future job generation. The Dayton VA is the major anchor of this region of the City, where is has been located for 150 years. It was dedicated as a National Landmark in 2012, and is home to nearly 2,200 employees, and has made tremendous investment in its facilities. Also situated here is the National Cemetery, and the new Fischer House (a 16-suite facility that will provide a free, temporary refuge for families supporting their loved one hospitalized for wounds, injuries, or illnesses), and the National VA Archives. While the VA obviously represents a major asset and institution, the designation of this area as an Opportunity Zone will help spur investment around the outside of the campus. Areas along West Third Street and U.S. 35 have the capacity to provide opportunities that are supporting of or complementary to the VA, and give the institution a surrounding area that everyone can be proud of.","The investment and importance of the VA Medical Center and National Cemetery; US 35 access; investment potential, especially at Wright Factory site.",21806,5002,578,572,405,167,729,-44.53488372093023,29.195804195804197

Dayton is known as the ?Birthplace of Aviation,? and home of the Wright Brothers who developed the airplane in their west side bicycle shop in the early 1900s. Aviation history has shaped Dayton and all of southwest Ohio to create highly efficient aerospace and manufacturing industry clusters. Today, part of the City of Dayton?s asset-based development strategy is focused on growing these important high-tech wealth-generating industries. The Northwest Industrial Park (NWIP) is one of the last greenfield development sites left for large-scale manufacturing in Dayton. With over 200 acres of farmland available for use on the far west side of Dayton, this area represents one of the city?s best available sites when competing against other communities in national site selection searches. It also has excellent access to utilities, including a massive 40MW electric transmission line owned by Dayton Power & Light. The area is bisected by Route 49, sometimes known as the Trotwood Connector, which represents the western beltway through Montgomery County. The limited access highway allows companies in the NWIP fast and easy access to both I-75 to the east and I-70 to the north, as well as the Dayton International Airport. The Dayton region has been successful in attracting logistics companies in recent years, and the NWIP is a prime location for such facilities. In addition to roadway and airport access, the NWIP is also somewhat unique for the region in that it has easy access to railroads operated by CSX Transportation. In the 1990?s, the City of Dayton bought a 4-mile stretch of the northwest lead track when CSX was considering abandoning the route. Today, this vital piece of infrastructure serves two of the largest companies in the impoverished west side of Dayton. In 2015, the City of Dayton and the Ohio Rail Development Commission (ORDC) partnered to fund an $830,000 capital investment in overdue track maintenance and repair. In 2004, this railroad was also crucial to attracting a substantial investment in new construction by the now-defunct Syncreon company, which was a GM distributor. Although that company is no more, their state-of-the-art building was recently acquired by Dayton company Stratacache, a rapidly growing business with international clients. They are projected to cross the $1 Billion sales threshold in the near future, with potential to grow even further. The area shares borders with neighboring communities Trotwood and Jefferson Township, which creates opportunities for intergovernmental cooperation and shared services. The NWIP also has access to Dayton?s extensive network of recreational trails, and the nearby Wesleyan MetroPark. On the other hand, the recent announcement regarding the closure of Good Samaritan Hospital, the only major medical center in this area, may add an additional challenge to attracting new investment to the NWIP. The Northwest Industrial Park is an excellent fit for an Opportunity Zone. By using this new incentive to attract businesses and real estate investment in this urban greenfield area, we can better utilize our infrastructure in ways that align with our vision for the community. The City?s asset-based strategy aligns perfectly with the Opportunity Zone program, which will be a key tool for attracting new high tech jobs to our region.","Much investment opportunity; great infrastructure (OH-49/US 35, 40MW electric transmission, rail).

The property in 100% subsidized. The project is a PRIORITY project designated by City of Dayton. Owned, managed and maintained for decades by Dayton Metropolitan Housing Authority (d/b/a Greater Dayton Premier Management), this pair of unique late art deco and mid-century modern apartment buildings need significant rehabilitation as several building systems are beyond useful life. The properties are sited in view of the Miami River, just across from the Downtown, where in less than one mile, over $28 million of revitalization has already been completed and an additional $16 million in future projects are committed and underway. The adjacency of the property to other vibrant neighborhoods and appeal of the Grafton Hill District is quickly being recognized, and as such, signs of gentrification in the area are quickly becoming apparent. Team While the project will remain within the continued ownership of Greater Dayton Premier Management and its affiliates, the housing authority has enlisted Woda Cooper Development, Inc. as co-developer, consultant and general contractor based on vast knowledge, experience and success in identifying comprehensive work scopes, financing, renovating, reconstructing and operating historic properties both eligible for placement on the National Register of Historic Places and serving as affordable low income housing. The combine talents of these two great teams will produce exceptional results. Approach In many past LIHTC projects, the proposed experienced development partners have successfully demonstrated how ideal it is to couple the various resources, programs and opportunities of the Ohio Housing Finance Agency, Ohio Developmental Services Agency, Ohio History Connection, State Office of Historic Preservation, National Parks Service, City of Dayton, Greater Dayton Premier Management and The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Hallmark and Meridian Buildings were built in the late Art Deco and Mid-Century Modern style originally as luxury high-end apartment buildings. The historic structures, built in 1948 and 1951, together with their dedicated parking garage, comprise a complex worthy of listing in the National Register of Historic places. Due to the historic nature of the buildings, the codevelopers have aligned a sensible and strategic use of capital resources to leverage LIHTC, Federal Historic Tax Credits, and DMHA?s Capital Funds. The resulting project will mean the proposed rehabilitation will incorporate the Secretary of the Interior?s standards for Treatment of Historic Properties, Enterprise Green Communities® standards for energy efficient housing, and the guidelines for accessibility published under the American?s with Disabilities Act ? all while accomplishing a complicated substantial rehabilitation. While general commons areas (with stainless steel detailing, iron railings, and decorative terrazzo floors) and amenity spaces will be repurposed, restored and returned to their former glory, the unit interiors will be completely refreshed to meet the needs of modern living standards. Recognizing that living patterns have changed, and that the market has a shortage of subsidized two-bedroom units, many inefficient existing large one-bedroom units will be reconfigured into much more efficient and accessible two-bedroom units.
